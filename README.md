###What was this project about?
This was another one of those projects that I had in my mind for a long time but just never really got to. One night, I took it upon myself to beat [The competition](http://www.snowdaycalculator.com/calculator.php). I hated the look of the competition's site and I thought it's algorithm could use some improvement since It would never get mine right.
